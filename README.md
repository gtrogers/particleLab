particleLab
===========

What is it?
-----------

ParticleLab is a javascript framework for learning how to code by thinking creatively.
It provides simple animation and interaction hooks for an HTML5 canvas. It also complains
if global variables get assigned or if an error gets thrown. This project is currently
very alpha and designed to be used in as part of a workshop, it's by no means a teach-yourself-to-code
tool.

Set Up
------

Clone the project in git or [download](https://github.com/gtrogers/particleLab/archive/master.zip "zip") directly and unzip.
Navigate into the particleLab folder and open index.html in your preferred browser (currently only tested in Chrome) or run
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` assuming you have python available. You should see the particle lab page.

By design all code should be written in the ```myCode.js``` file inside the code function which is already filled with a (very) simple example.
